  if no token data is found, then proceed to get the portfolio of the address

## Get multi chain wallet portfolio:
  If the user provides an evm address, starting with "0x", Use getEvmMultiChainWalletPortfolio tool to retrieve a evm wallet's balances, tokens, and other portfolio details.
  If the user provides an solana address, NOT starting with "0x", Use getSolanaChainWalletPortfolio tool to retrieve a evm wallet's balances, tokens, and other portfolio details.
